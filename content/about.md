I'm also Member of [**Free Software Foundation Europe**](http://fsfe.org/), [**OpenStreetMap Foundation**](http://osmfoundation.org/), [**Spanish Red Cross**](http://www.cruzroja.es/), [**Doctors Without Borders**](https://www.msf.es/), [**Amnesty International**](https://www.amnesty.org/es/) and [**UNHCR**](http://www.acnur.org/).

I love hiking, cycling (cycle tourism specially) and traditional archery to the point that I'm federated in [**RFETA** (Spanish Federation of Archery)](https://www.federarco.es/) and [**AAL-IFAA** (International Field Archery Association)](http://ifaa-spain.es/) and I've co-founded with other friends our own traditional archery club: [the **Archers of Ithilien**](http://ithilien.es/).
