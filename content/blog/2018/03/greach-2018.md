Some days ago I attended, as usual, to the fantastic [**Greach Conference**](http://2018.greachconf.com/), an international conference about the [Apache Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) language and ecosystem: Groovy, Grails, Gradle,... Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it's surely one of the Top worldwide events about this technologies.

Greach is a **non-profitable** event is organized by [**Iván López** (@ilopar)](https://twitter.com/ilopmar) and [**Alberto Vilches** (@albertovilches)](http://twitter.com/albertovilches), with some help from colleagues and [a lot of sponsors](http://2018.greachconf.com/#tile_sponsors).

**TLDR;** The conference content and speakers were great, in addition to the logistics. I couldn't attend the workshop day (my fault), and it was a pity specially because this year I had paid for it. Apart from learning (as usual), this year was specially exciting with the worldwide announcement of [**Micronaut**](http://micronaut.io/).

Let me summarize some of the talks I attended:
