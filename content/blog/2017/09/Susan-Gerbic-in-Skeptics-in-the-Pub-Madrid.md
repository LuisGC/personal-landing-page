As you probably know, we are celebrating the **XXX Anniversary** of [**ARP-SAPC**](http://escepticos.es) with a [special event this next Saturday (Sep 30th)](http://www.escepticos.es/escepticos-en-el-pub) with **Alfonso López Borgoñoz** ([@lopezborgonoz](https://www.twitter.com/lopezborgonoz)). As an addition to this celebration, a week later we'll be honoured to host a **Skeptics in the Pub Madrid** special event with **Susan Gerbic**.

Affectionately called the Wikipediatrician, [**Susan Gerbic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Gerbic) is the cofounder of **Monterey County Skeptics** and a self-proclaimed _skeptical junkie_. Susan is also founder of the [**Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia (GSoW)** project](http://guerrillaskepticismonwikipedia.blogspot.com.es/). She is a frequent contributor to [**Skeptical Inquirer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_Inquirer) and [**Skepticality Podcast**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticality). She is the winner of the _CSI In the Trenches Award_ from 2012, _James Randi Award for Skepticism in the Public Interest_ from 2013 and a Scientific and Technical Consultant for the [**Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Skeptical_Inquiry).

Our SitP event will be the last stage for Susan in a [huge tour all through Europe](https://fundly.com/about-time-tour-skeptical-networking-across-europe#home). She's been (or plans to be, as the tour is currently ongoing) in Oslo (Norway), Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark), Malmö (Sweden), Prague (Czech Republic), Wrocław (Poland, for the [17th European Skeptics Congress](http://euroscepticscon.org/en/)), Göttingen (Germany), Frankfurt (Germany), Zurich (Switzerland), Cesena (Italy, for the [CICAPFest 2017](http://www.cicap.org/convegno/2017/)), Budapest (Hungary), Ljubljana (Slovenia), Sofia (Bulgaria) and finally Madrid. For more details about her tour, you can start with [this video](https://www.facebook.com/Gerbic/videos/10155586328243771/) of Susan explaining the details.

One important thing. **The talk that Susan has prepared for us will be in English**, although in the Q&A it will be possible to make questions in Spanish and we will translate whatever is necessary. The content of the talk, as described by herself:

<blockquote>You supported the March for Science. Now what?  Susan Gerbic will be explaining why the answer is to join her project, Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia (GSoW). She will explain why improving the pages for Science and Scientific Skepticism on the 10th most popular website improves education world-wide. GSoW works to support the people and organizations that do the research, write the books, organize the conferences and take the heat from the anti-science and paranormal world.  GSoW gives them the best possible Wikipedia pages possible, while following all the rules of Wikipedia. The GSoW has had a large impact on education around the world since 2010. The GSoW has written and rewritten over 400 Wikipedia pages in many languages. All training is done online, self-paced and with a personal trainer. All GSoW members join the Secret Cabal hidden away on Facebook where new recruits learn the secret handshake. Previous pages include; Spontaneous Human Combustion, Facilitated Communication, Catherine de Jong, Cornelis de Jager, Massimo Polidoro, Massimo Pigliucci, Leo Igwe, Gábor Hraskó, VoF, ARP-SAPC, Klub Sceptyków Polskich, Chupacabras, CICAP, CSICOP, Association française pour l'information scientifique, GWUP, and many many more.</blockquote>
